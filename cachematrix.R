## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
# For large square matrices, it may take too long to compute the inverse, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly 
# (e.g. in a loop). If the contents of the matrix do not change, it may make sense to cache the matrix inverse so that, 
# when we need it again, it can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this Programming Assignment, we take 
# advantage of the scoping rules of the R language and observe how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside of an R object.

#  For this assignment, we introduce the <<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment that
#  is different from the current environment. Below are two functions that we will use to create a special object that stores a
#  square matrix and caches its inverse.

## Write a short comment describing this function
# The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special “matrix”, which is really a list containing a function to:

# set the elements of the matrix
# get the elements of the matrix
# set the elements of the matrix inverse
# get the elements of the matrix inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
# The following function calculates the inverse of the special “matrix” created with the above function. However, 
# it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and 
# skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets it in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  matrix_to_invert <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(matrix_to_invert, ...)
  x$setinverse(inv)
  inv
